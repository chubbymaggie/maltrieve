## Maltrieve

Maltrieve originated as a fork of [mwcrawler](https://github.com/ricardo-dias/mwcrawler). It retrieves malware directly from the sources as listed at a number of sites, including:

* [Malc0de](http://malc0de.com/rss)
* [Malware Black List](http://www.malwareblacklist.com/mbl.xml)
* [Malware Domain List](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/mdl.xml)
* [VX Vault](http://vxvault.siri-urz.net/URL_List.php)
* [URLqery](http://urlquery.net/)
* [CleanMX](http://support.clean-mx.de/clean-mx/xmlviruses.php?)

These lists will be implemented if/when they return to activity.

* [NovCon Minotaur](http://minotauranalysis.com/malwarelist-urls.aspx)

Other improvements include:

* Proxy support
* Multithreading for improved performance
* Logging of source URLs
* Multiple user agent support
* Better error handling
* [VxCage](https://github.com/botherder/vxcage) and [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) support


## Installation

Maltrieve requires the following dependencies:

* Python 2 (2.6 should be sufficient)
* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) version 4
